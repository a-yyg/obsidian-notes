Read up on some of the notes by [Ryuz88](https://zenn.dev/ryuz88):
- [Kria KV260 環境構築メモ](https://zenn.dev/ryuz88/articles/kv260_setup_memo)
- [Kria KV260 の 認定Ubuntu で RPU (Cortex-R5) を認識させる](https://ryuz.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/05/04/100016)
- [Kria KV260 環境構築メモ(Ubuntu22.04 版)](https://zenn.dev/ryuz88/articles/kv260_setup_memo_ubuntu22)
It seems I actually read some of this guy's articles before. In particular, [this one](https://zenn.dev/ryuz88/articles/kv260_led_blinking) for LED blinking really helped me getting started.

Ryuz88 (Ryuji Fuchikami) seems to be working on some interesting things regarding Xilinx FPGAs:
- [GitHub - ryuz/jelly: Original FPGA platform](https://github.com/ryuz/jelly)
- [ZynqMPを理解しよう](https://zenn.dev/ryuz88/books/zynqmp_study)
	- I really should read all of this.
